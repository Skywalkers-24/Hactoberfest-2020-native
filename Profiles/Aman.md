### Projects

- [Dummy Ecom API](https://github.com/aman162000/dummy-ecom-api) A Dummy API is useful during development and testing when live data is either unavailable or unreliable. As someone who wants to practise developing e-commerce websites, it might be hard to find any dummy data to use as a placeholder throughout the development phase. Some e-commerce platform provide Apis but, these APIs are complex in implementation and includes Authorization.

- [Mask Detection and Penalty System](https://github.com/aman162000/mask_detection) According to the World Health Organization (WHO), wearing masks in public places or congested areas is the most important form of safety for people. This paper presents a two-class classification model for detecting face masks, such as "mask detected" and "no mask detected." We achieved an accuracy of 98.89% using deep learning and 97.5% using machine learning. If a person is not wearing a mask, then that person has to pay the fine using the "Payment ID" received via text message and these messages are sent with the help of face-recognition. The model will work with static images as well as a live video stream. It is also possible to provide mass screening, and it can be used in congested or crowded areas such as stores, malls, and colleges, and others.
