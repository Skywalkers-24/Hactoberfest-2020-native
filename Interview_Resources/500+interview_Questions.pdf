1) What are the differences between C++ and Java ?
Platformindependent
C++ is platform-dependent. Java is platform-independent.
Mainly used 
for
C++ is mainly used for system 
programming.
Java is mainly used for application programming. It is 
widely used in window, web-based, enterprise and 
mobile applications.
Design Goal C++ was designed for systems 
and applications 
programming. It was an 
extension of C programming 
language.
Java was designed and created as an interpreter for 
printing systems but later extended as a support 
network computing. It was designed with a goal of 
being easy to use and accessible to a broader 
audience.
Goto C++ supports 
the goto statement.
Java doesn't support the goto statement.
Multiple 
inheritance
C++ supports multiple 
inheritance.
Java doesn't support multiple inheritance through 
class. It can be achieved by interfaces in java.
Operator 
Overloading
C++ supports operator 
overloading.
Java doesn't support operator overloading.
Pointers C++ supports pointers. You 
can write pointer program in 
C++.
Java supports pointer internally. However, you can't 
write the pointer program in java. It means java has 
restricted pointer support in java.
Compiler and 
Interpreter
C++ uses compiler only. C++ is 
compiled and run using the 
compiler which converts 
source code into machine 
Java uses compiler and interpreter both. Java source 
code is converted into bytecode at compilation time. 
The interpreter executes this bytecode at runtime and 
produces output. Java is interpreted that is why it is 
platform independent.

COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
code so, C++ is platform 
dependent.
Call by Value 
and Call by 
reference
C++ supports both call by
value and call by reference.
Java supports call by value only. There is no call by 
reference in java.
Structure and 
Union
C++ supports structures and 
unions.
Java doesn't support structures and unions.
Thread Support C++ doesn't have built-in 
support for threads. It relies 
on third-party libraries for 
thread support.
Java has built-in thread support.
Documentation 
comment
C++ doesn't support 
documentation comment.
Java supports documentation comment (/** ... */) to 
create documentation for java source code.
Virtual 
Keyword
C++ supports virtual keyword 
so that we can decide 
whether or not override a 
function.
Java has no virtual keyword. We can override all nonstatic methods by default. In other words, non-static 
methods are virtual by default.
unsigned right 
shift >>>
C++ doesn't support >>> 
operator.
Java supports unsigned right shift >>> operator that 
fills zero at the top for the negative numbers. For 
positive numbers, it works same like >> operator.
Inheritance 
Tree
C++ creates a new 
inheritance tree always.
Java uses a single inheritance tree always because all 
classes are the child of Object class in java. The object 
class is the root of the inheritance tree in java.
Hardware C++ is nearer to hardware. Java is not so interactive with hardware.
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
Objectoriented
C++ is an object-oriented 
language. However, in C 
language, single root 
hierarchy is not possible.
Java is also an object-oriented language. However, 
everything (except fundamental types) is an object in 
Java. It is a single root hierarchy as everything gets 
derived from java.lang.Object.
2) What are the features of Java Programming Language?
There are the following features in Java Programming Language.
o Simple: Java is easy to learn. The syntax of Java is based on C++ which makes easier to 
write the program in it.
o Object-Oriented: Java follows the object-oriented paradigm which allows us to 
maintain our code as the combination of different type of objects that incorporates 
both data and behaviour.
o Portable: Java supports read-once-write-anywhere approach. We can execute the 
Java program on every machine. Java program (.java) is converted to bytecode (.class) 
which can be easily run on every machine.
o Platform Independent: Java is a platform independent programming language. It is 
different from other programming languages like C and C++ which needs a platform to 
be executed. Java comes with its platform on which its code is executed. Java doesn't 
depend upon the operating system to be executed.
o Secured: Java is secured because it doesn't use explicit pointers. Java also provides the 
concept of Byte Code and Exception handling which makes it more secured.
o Robust: Java is a strong programming language as it uses strong memory 
management. The concepts like Automatic garbage collection, Exception handling, 
etc. make it more robust.
o Architecture Neutral: Java is architectural neutral as it is not dependent on the 
architecture. In C, the size of data types may vary according to the architecture (32 bit 
or 64 bit) which doesn't exist in Java.
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
o Interpreted: Java uses the Just-in-time (JIT) interpreter along with the compiler for the 
program execution.
o High Performance: Java is faster than other traditional interpreted programming 
languages because Java bytecode is "close" to native code. It is still a little bit slower 
than a compiled language (e.g., C++).
o Multithreaded: We can write Java programs that deal with many tasks at once by 
defining multiple threads. The main advantage of multi-threading is that it doesn't 
occupy memory for each thread. It shares a common memory area. Threads are 
important for multi-media, Web applications, etc.
o Distributed: Java is distributed because it facilitates users to create distributed 
applications in Java. RMI and EJB are used for creating distributed applications. This 
feature of Java makes us able to access files by calling the methods from any machine 
on the internet.
o Dynamic: Java is a dynamic language. It supports dynamic loading of classes. It means 
classes are loaded on demand. It also supports functions from its native languages, 
i.e., C and C++.
3) What is JVM ?
Java Virtual Machine is a virtual machine that enables the computer to run the Java program. 
JVM acts like a run-time engine which calls the main method present in the Java code. JVM is the 
specification which must be implemented in the computer system. The Java code is compiled by 
JVM to be a Bytecode which is machine independent and close to the native code.
4) What is JIT Compiler ?
Just-In-Time(JIT) compiler: It is used to improve the performance. JIT compiles parts of the 
bytecode that have similar functionality at the same time, and hence reduces the amount of time 
needed for compilation. Here the term “compiler” refers to a translator from the instruction set 
of a Java virtual machine (JVM) to the instruction set of a specific CPU.
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
5) What are the different access specifiers in Java ?
In Java, access specifiers are the keywords which are used to define the access scope of the 
method, class, or a variable. In Java, there are four access specifiers given below.
• Public: The classes, methods, or variables which are defined as public, can be accessed 
by any class or method.
• Protected: Protected can be accessed by the class of the same package, or by the subclass of this class, or within the same class.
• Default: Default are accessible within the package only. By default, all the classes, 
methods, and variables are of default scope.
• Private: The private class, methods, or variables defined as private can be accessed 
within the class only.
6) What is the difference between an object-oriented programming language and objectbased programming language?
There are the following basic differences between the object-oriented language and objectbased language.
• Object-oriented languages follow all the concepts of OOPs whereas, the object-based 
language doesn't follow all the concepts of OOPs like inheritance and polymorphism.
• Object-oriented languages do not have the inbuilt objects whereas Object-based languages 
have the inbuilt objects, for example, JavaScript has window object.
• Examples of object-oriented programming are Java, C#, Smalltalk, etc. whereas the examples 
of object-based languages are JavaScript, VBScript, etc.
7) What are the features of OOP?
The important features of Object-Oriented programming are:
• Classes and Objects
These contain data and functions bundled together under a unit. In other words, class is 
a collection of similar objects. When we define a class it just creates template or Skelton. 
So no memory is created when class is created. Memory is occupied only by object.
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
Example:
Class className
{
Data 
Functions
};
main ( )
{
className objectname1,objectname2,..;
}
In other words classes acts as data types for objects.
Objects are the instances of a class.
• Inheritance
Inheritance is an important pillar of OOP(Object Oriented Programming). It is the 
mechanism in java by which one class is allow to inherit the features(fields and 
methods) of another class.
• Polymorphism
The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define 
polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.
• Data Abstraction
Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details. Data 
abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside 
world, hiding the background details or implementation.
• Data Encapsulation
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up of data and information under a single unit. In 
Object-Oriented Programming, Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data 
and the functions that manipulate them.
• Dynamic Binding
In dynamic binding, the code to be executed in response to function call is decided at 
runtime.
• Message Passing
Objects communicate with one another by sending and receiving information to each 
other. A message for an object is a request for execution of a procedure and therefore 
will invoke a function in the receiving object that generates the desired results. Message 
passing involves specifying the name of the object, the name of the function and the 
information to be sent.
8) What is Inline function?
Inline function is a technique used by the compilers and instructs to insert complete body of the 
function wherever that function is used in the program source code.
9) What is an abstract class?
An abstract class is a class which cannot be instantiated. Creation of an object is not possible 
with abstract class but it can be inherited. An abstract class can contain only Abstract method. 
Java allows only abstract method in abstract class while for other language it allows nonabstract method as well.
10) What is an abstract class?
An abstract class is a class which cannot be instantiated. Creation of an object is not possible 
with abstract class , but it can be inherited. An abstract class can contain only Abstract method. 
Java allows only abstract method in abstract class while for other language it allows nonabstract method as well.

COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
11) What is an interface ?
An interface is a collection of abstract method. If the class implements an inheritance, and then 
thereby inherits all the abstract methods of an interface.
12) What is exception handling ?
Exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program. Exceptions can be of any 
type — Run time exception, Error exceptions. Those exceptions are handled properly through 
exception handling mechanism like try, catch and throw keywords.
13) What is static and dynamic binding ?
Binding is nothing but the association of a name with the class. Static binding is a binding in 
which name can be associated with the class during compilation time and it is also called as 
early Binding.
Dynamic binding is a binding in which name can be associated with the class during 
execution time and it is also called as Late Binding.
14) What is a copy constructor ?
This is a special constructor for creating a new object as a copy of an existing object. There will 
be always only on copy constructor that can be either defined by the user or the system.
15) What is the difference between a structure and a class ?
Structure default access type is public but class access type is private. A structure is used for 
grouping data whereas class can be used for grouping data and methods. Structures are 
exclusively used for data and it doesn’t require strict validation but classes are used to 
encapsulates and inherit data which requires strict validation.
16) Why is C known as the Mother Language ?
C is known as a mother language because most of the compilers and JVMs are written in C 
language. Most of the languages which are developed after C language has borrowed heavily
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
from it like C++, Python, Rust, JavaScript, etc. It introduces new core concepts like arrays, 
functions, file handling which are used in these languages.
17) What are the differences between Local Variables and Global Variables?
Basis for 
comparison
Local variable Global variable
Declaration A variable which is declared inside 
function or block is known as a 
local variable.
A variable which is declared 
outside function or block is 
known as a global variable.
Scope The scope of a variable is available 
within a function in which they are 
declared.
The scope of a variable is 
available throughout the 
program.
Access Variables can be accessed only by 
those statements inside a function 
in which they are declared.
Any statement in the entire 
program can access variables.
Life Life of a variable is created when 
the function block is entered and 
destroyed on its exit.
Life of a variable exists until 
the program is executing.
Storage Variables are stored in a stack 
unless specified.
The compiler decides the 
storage location of a variable.
18) What is the use of writing a function in C Programming Language?
• C functions are used to avoid the rewriting the same code again and again in our 
program.
• C functions can be called any number of times from any place of our program.
• When a program is divided into functions, then any part of our program can easily be 
tracked.
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
• C functions provide the reusability concept, i.e., it breaks the big task into smaller tasks 
so that it makes the C program more understandable.
19) What is the difference between Call By Value and Call By Reference?
Call by value Call by reference
Description When a copy of the value is 
passed to the function, then the 
original value is not modified.
When a copy of the value is 
passed to the function, then the 
original value is modified.
Memory 
location
Actual arguments and formal 
arguments are created in separate 
memory locations.
Actual arguments and formal 
arguments are created in the 
same memory location.
Safety In this case, actual arguments 
remain safe as they cannot be 
modified.
In this case, actual arguments 
are not reliable, as they are 
modified.
Arguments The copies of the actual 
arguments are passed to the 
formal arguments.
The addresses of actual 
arguments are passed to their 
respective formal arguments.
20) What is recursion in C ?
When a function calls itself, and this process is known as recursion. The function that calls 
itself is known as a recursive function.
Recursive function comes in two phases:
Winding phase: When the recursive function calls itself, and this phase ends when the 
condition is reached.
Unwinding phase: Unwinding phase starts when the condition is reached, and the control 
returns to the original call.

21) What is a pointer in C?
A pointer is a variable that refers to the address of a value. It makes the code optimized and 
makes the performance fast. Whenever a variable is declared inside a program, then the system 
allocates some memory to a variable. The memory contains some address number. The 
variables that hold this address number is known as the pointer variable.
22) What is a NULL pointer ?
A pointer that doesn't refer to any address of value but NULL is known as a NULL pointer. When 
we assign a '0' value to a pointer of any type, then it becomes a Null pointer.
23) What is a far pointer in C ?
A pointer which can access all the 16 segments (whole residence memory) of RAM is known as 
far pointer. A far pointer is a 32-bit pointer that obtains information outside the memory in a 
given section.
24) What is a dangling pointer in C ?
• If a pointer is pointing any memory location, but meanwhile another pointer deletes the 
memory occupied by the first pointer while the first pointer still points to that memory 
location, the first pointer will be known as a dangling pointer. This problem is known as 
a dangling pointer problem.
• Dangling pointer arises when an object is deleted without modifying the value of the 
pointer. The pointer points to the deallocated memory.
25) What is the usage of Pointer in C ?
• Accessing array elements: Pointers are used in traversing through an array of integers 
and strings. The string is an array of characters which is terminated by a null character 
'\0'.
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
• Dynamic memory allocation: Pointers are used in allocation and deallocation of memory 
during the execution of a program.
• Call by Reference: The pointers are used to pass a reference of a variable to other 
function.
• Data Structures like a tree, graph, linked list, etc.: The pointers are used to construct 
different data structures like tree, graph, linked list, etc.
26) What is Static Memory Allocation ?
• In case of static memory allocation, memory is allocated at compile time, and memory 
can't be increased while executing the program. It is used in the array.
• The lifetime of a variable in static memory is the lifetime of a program.
• The static memory is allocated using static keyword.
• The static memory is implemented using stacks or heap.
• The pointer is required to access the variable present in the static memory.
• The static memory is faster than dynamic memory.
• In static memory, more memory space is required to store the variable.
27) What is Dynamic Memory Allocation ?
• In case of dynamic memory allocation, memory is allocated at runtime and memory can 
be increased while executing the program. It is used in the linked list.
• The malloc() or calloc() function is required to allocate the memory at the runtime.
• An allocation or deallocation of memory is done at the execution time of a program.
• No dynamic pointers are required to access the memory.
• The dynamic memory is implemented using data segments.
• Less memory space is required to store the variable.
28) What is a structure ?
• The structure is a user-defined data type that allows storing multiple types of data in a 
single unit. It occupies the sum of the memory of all members.
• The structure members can be accessed only through structure variables.
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
• Structure variables accessing the same structure but the memory allocated for each 
variable will be different.
29) What is a union ?
• The union is a user-defined data type that allows storing multiple types of data in a 
single unit. However, it doesn't occupy the sum of the memory of all members. It holds 
the memory of the largest member only.
• In union, we can access only one variable at a time as it allocates one common space for 
all the members of a union.
30) What is an auto keyword in C ?
In C, every local variable of a function is known as an automatic (auto) variable. Variables which 
are declared inside the function block are known as a local variable. The local variables are also 
known as an auto variable. It is optional to use an auto keyword before the data type of a 
variable. If no value is stored in the local variable, then it consists of a garbage value.
31) What is a token ?
The Token is an identifier. It can be constant, keyword, string literal, etc. A token is the smallest 
individual unit in a program. C has the following tokens:
Identifiers: Identifiers refer to the name of the variables.
Keywords: Keywords are the predefined words that are explained by the compiler.
Constants: Constants are the fixed values that cannot be changed during the execution of a 
program.
Operators: An operator is a symbol that performs the particular operation.
Special characters: All the characters except alphabets and digits are treated as special 
characters.
32) What is command line argument ?
The argument passed to the main() function while executing the program is known as 
command line argument. For example:
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
main(int count, char *args[])
{ 
//code to be executed 
} 
33) What is a file?
A file is a named location which stores data or information permanently. A file is always 
stored inside a storage device using file name (e.g. STUDENT.MARKS). A file name 
normally has primary and secondary name separated by a “.”(DOT).
34) What is the difference between Function Overloading and Overriding ?
Overloading is when two or more methods in the same class have the
same method name but different parameters(i.e different method
signatures).
Overriding is when two methods having the same method name and
parameters (i.e., method signature) but one of the methods is in the
parent class and the other is in the child class.
35) What is a deadlock in OS ?
Deadlock is a situation or condition where the two processes are waiting for each other 
to complete so that they can start. This result both the processes to hang.
36) What is Context Switching ?
Transferring the control from one process to other process requires saving the state of 
the old process and loading the saved state for new process. This task is known as 
context switching.
37) Differentiate between Compiler and Interpreter.
An interpreter reads one instruction at a time and carries out the actions
implied by that instruction. It does not perform any translation. But a
compiler translates the entire instructions.

38) What are the differences between list and tuple in Python ?
LIST TUPLES
Lists are mutable i.e they can be 
edited.
Tuples are immutable (tuples are lists which 
can’t be edited).
Lists are slower than tuples. Tuples are faster than list.
Syntax: list_1 = [10, ‘Chelsea’, 20] Syntax: tup_1 = (10, ‘Chelsea’ , 20)
39) What type of language is Python ? Scripting or Programming ?
Python is capable of scripting, but in general sense, it is considered as a generalpurpose programming language.
40) What is type conversion in Python ?
Type conversion refers to the conversion of one data type into another.
int() – converts any data type into integer type
float() – converts any data type into float type
ord() – converts characters into integer
hex() – converts integers to hexadecimal
oct() – converts integer to octal
tuple() – This function is used to convert to a tuple.
set() – This function returns the type after converting to set.
list() – This function is used to convert any data type to a list type.
dict() – This function is used to convert a tuple of order (key,value) into a 
dictionary.
str() – Used to convert integer into a string.
complex(real,imag) – This functionconverts real numbers to 
complex(real,imag) number.
41) What is pickling and unpickling in Python ?
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
Pickle module accepts any Python object and converts it into a string 
representation and dumps it into a file by using dump function, this process is 
called pickling. While the process of retrieving original Python objects from the 
stored string representation is called unpickling.
42) How to comment multiple lines in Python ?
Multi-line comments appear in more than one line. All the lines to be commented are 
to be prefixed by a #. You can also a very good shortcut method to comment multiple 
lines. All you need to do is hold the ctrl key and left click in every place wherever you 
want to include a # character and type a # just once. This will comment all the lines 
where you introduced your cursor.
43) What are docstrings in Python ?
Docstrings are not actually comments, but, they are documentation strings. These 
docstrings are within triple quotes. They are not assigned to any variable and 
therefore, at times, serve the purpose of comments as well.
44) What is a dictionary in Python ?
The built-in datatypes in Python is called dictionary. It defines one-to-one relationship 
between keys and values. Dictionaries contain pair of keys and their corresponding 
values. Dictionaries are indexed by keys.
45) What advantages do NumPy arrays offer over (nested) Python lists?
• Python’s lists are efficient general-purpose containers. They support (fairly) 
efficient insertion, deletion, appending, and concatenation, and Python’s list 
comprehensions make them easy to construct and manipulate.
• They have certain limitations: they don’t support “vectorized” operations like 
elementwise addition and multiplication, and the fact that they can contain 
objects of differing types mean that Python must store type information for every 
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
element, and must execute type dispatching code when operating on each 
element.
• NumPy is not just more efficient; it is also more convenient. You get a lot of vector 
and matrix operations for free, which sometimes allow one to avoid unnecessary 
work. And they are also efficiently implemented.
• NumPy array is faster and You get a lot built in with NumPy, FFTs, convolutions, 
fast searching, basic statistics, linear algebra, histograms, etc.
46) Does Python have OOPS Concept ?
Python is an object-oriented programming language. This means that any program 
can be solved in python by creating an object model. However, Python can be 
treated as procedural as well as structural language.
47) What is __init__ ?
__init__ is a method or constructor in Python. This method is automatically called to 
allocate memory when a new object/ instance of a class is created. All classes have
the __init__ method.
48) What is meant by Database ?
In simple terms, Database is a collection of data in some organized way to facilitate 
its user’s to easily access, manage and upload the data.
49) What are the advantages of DBMS ?
• Controlled Redundancy: DBMS supports a mechanism to control redundancy of 
data inside the database by integrating all the data into a single database and as 
data is stored at only one place, the duplicity of data does not happen.
• Data Sharing: Sharing of data among multiple users simultaneously can also be 
done in DBMS as the same database will be shared among all the users and by 
different application programs.
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
• Backup and Recovery Facility: DBMS minimizes the pain of creating the backup of 
data again and again by providing a feature of ‘backup and recovery’ which 
automatically creates the data backup and restores the data whenever required.
• Enforcement of Integrity Constraints: Integrity Constraints are very important to be 
enforced on the data so that the refined data after putting some constraints are 
stored in the database and this is followed by DBMS.
• Independence of Data: It simply means that you can change the structure of the 
data without affecting the structure of any of the application programs.
50) What is the use of Normalization in DBMS ?
Normalization is the process of analyzing the relational schemas which are based on 
their respective functional dependencies and the primary keys in order to fulfill certain 
properties.
The properties include:
▪ To minimize the redundancy of the Data.
▪ To minimize the Insert, Delete and Update Anomalies.
51) What are the differences between Primary Key and Unique Key ?
• The main difference between the Primary key and Unique key is that the Primary 
key can never have a null value while the Unique key may consist of null value.
• In each table, there can be only one primary key while there can be more than one 
unique key in a table.
52) Explain ACID properties in DBMS.
• Atomicity: This is based on the concept of “either all or nothing” which basically 
means that if any update occurs inside the database then that update should 
either be available to all the others beyond user and application program or it 
should not be available to anyone beyond the user and application program.
• Consistency: This ensures that the consistency is maintained in the database 
before or after any transaction that takes place inside the database.
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
• Isolation: As the name itself suggests, this property states that each transaction 
that is occurring is in isolation with others i.e. a transaction which has started but 
not yet completed should be in isolation with others so that the other transaction 
does not get impacted with this transaction.
• Durability: This property states that the data should always be in a durable state 
i.e. any data which is in the committed state should be available in the same state 
even if any failure or restart occurs in the system.
53) Explain Entity, Entity Type, and Entity Set in DBMS?\
• Entity is an object, place or thing which has its independent existence in the 
real world and about which data can be stored in a database. Eg: any person, 
book, etc.
• Entity Type is a collection of the entities which have the same attributes. Eg: 
STUDENT table contains rows in which each row is an entity holding attributes 
like name, age , and id of the students, hence STUDENT is an Entity Type which 
holds the entities having same attributes.
• Entity Set is a collection of the entities of the same type. Eg: A collection of the 
employees of a firm.
54) What are the different levels of abstraction in DBMS ?
There are 3 levels of data abstraction in the DBMS.
• Physical Level: This is the lowest level of the data abstraction which states 
how the data is stored in the database.
• Logical Level: This is the next level of the data abstraction which states the 
type of the data and the relationship among the data that is stored in the
database.
• View Level: This is the highest level in the data abstraction which 
shows/states only a part of the database.
55) What is a functional dependency in DBMS ?
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
This is basically a constraint which is useful in describing the relationship among the 
different attributes in a relation.
Example: If there is some relation ‘R1’ which has 2 attributes as Y and Z then the 
functional dependency among these 2 attributes can be shown as Y->Z which states 
that Z is functionally dependent on Y.
56) How is pattern matching done in SQL ?
With the help of the LIKE operator, pattern matching is possible in the SQL.’%’ is used 
with the Like operator when it matches with the 0 or more characters and ‘_’ is used 
to match the one particular character.
Example:
• select * from Emp where name like ‘b%’
• select * from Emp where name like ‘hans_’
57) What are the different types of relationships in RDBMS ?
One-to-One: This basically states that there should be a one-to-one relationship 
between the tables i.e. there should be one record in both the tables. Eg: Among a 
married couple, both wife and husband can have only one spouse.
One-to-Many: This states that there can be many relationships for one i.e. a primary 
key table hold only one record which can have many, one or none records in the 
related table. Eg: A Mother can have many children.
Many-to-Many: This states that both the tables can be related to many other tables. 
Eg: One can have many siblings and so do they have.
58) What is data structure?
Data structure refers to the way data is organized and manipulated. It seeks to find ways 
to make data access more efficient. When dealing with the data structure, we not only 
focus on one piece of data but the different set of data and how they can relate to one 
another in an organized manner.
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
59) Differentiate between file and structure storage structure.
The key difference between both the data structure is the memory area that is being 
accessed. When dealing with the structure that resides the main memory of the 
computer system, this is referred to as storage structure. When dealing with an auxiliary 
structure, we refer to it as file structures.
60) When is a binary search best applied?
A binary search is an algorithm that is best applied to search a list when the elements are 
already in order or sorted. The list is searched starting in the middle, such that if that 
middle value is not the target search key, it will check to see if it will continue the search 
on the lower half of the list or the higher half. The split and search will then continue in 
the same manner.
61) What is a linked list?
A linked list is a sequence of nodes in which each node is connected to the node 
following it. This forms a chain-like link for data storage.
62) How do you reference all the elements in a one-dimension array?
To reference all the elements in a one -dimension array, you need to use an indexed 
loop, So that, the counter runs from 0 to the array size minus one. In this manner, You 
can reference all the elements in sequence by using the loop counter as the array 
subscript.
63) In what areas do data structures are applied?
Data structures are essential in almost every aspect where data is involved. In general, 
algorithms that involve efficient data structure is applied in the following areas: 
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
numerical analysis, operating system, A.I., compiler design, database management, 
graphics, and statistical analysis, to name a few.
64) What is LIFO?
LIFO is a short form of Last In First Out. It refers how data is accessed, stored and 
retrieved. Using this scheme, data that was stored last should be the one to be extracted 
first. This also means that in order to gain access to the first data, all the other data that 
was stored before this first data must first be retrieved and extracted.
65) What is a queue?
A queue is a data structure that can simulate a list or stream of data. In this structure, 
new elements are inserted at one end, and existing elements are removed from the 
other end.
66) What are binary trees?
A binary tree is one type of data structure that has two nodes, a left node, and a right 
node. In programming, binary trees are an extension of the linked list structures.
67) Which data structures are applied when dealing with a recursive function?
Recursion, is a function that calls itself based on a terminating condition, makes use of 
the stack. Using LIFO, a call to a recursive function saves the return address so that it 
knows how to return to the calling function after the call terminates.
68) What is a stack?
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
A stack is a data structure in which only the top element can be accessed. As data is 
stored in the stack, each data is pushed downward, leaving the most recently added data 
on top.
69) Explain Binary Search Tree
A binary search tree stores data in such a way that they can be retrieved very efficiently. 
The left subtree contains nodes whose keys are less than the node’s key value, while the 
right subtree contains nodes whose keys are greater than or equal to the node’s key 
value. Moreover, both subtrees are also binary search trees.
70) What are multidimensional arrays?
Multidimensional arrays make use of multiple indexes to store data. It is useful when 
storing data that cannot be represented using single dimensional indexing, such as data 
representation in a board game, tables with data stored in more than one column.
71) Are linked lists considered linear or non-linear data structures?
It depends on where you intend to apply linked lists. If you based it on storage, a linked 
list is considered non-linear. On the other hand, if you based it on access strategies, then 
a linked list is considered linear.
72) How does dynamic memory allocation help in managing data?
Apart from being able to store simple structured data types, dynamic memory allocation 
can combine separately allocated structured blocks to form composite structures that 
expand and contract as needed.
73) What is FIFO?
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
FIFO stands for First-in, First-out, and is used to represent how data is accessed in a 
queue. Data has been inserted into the queue list the longest is the one that is removed 
first.
74) What is an ordered list?
An ordered list is a list in which each node’s position in the list is determined by the 
value of its key component, so that the key values form an increasing sequence, as the 
list is traversed.
75) What is merge sort?
Merge sort, is a divide-and-conquer approach for sorting the data. In a sequence of 
data, adjacent ones are merged and sorted to create bigger sorted lists. These sorted 
lists are then merged again to form an even bigger sorted list, which continues until you 
have one single sorted list.
76) Differentiate NULL and VOID
Null is a value, whereas Void is a data type identifier. A variable that is given a Null value 
indicates an empty value. The void is used to identify pointers as having no initial size.
77) What is the primary advantage of a linked list?
A linked list is an ideal data structure because it can be modified easily. This means that 
editing a linked list works regardless of how many elements are in the list.
78) What is the difference between a PUSH and a POP?
Pushing and popping applies to the way data is stored and retrieved in a stack. A push 
denotes data being added to it, meaning data is being “pushed” into the stack. On the 
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
other hand, a pop denotes data retrieval, and in particular, refers to the topmost data 
being accessed.
79) What is a linear search?
A linear search refers to the way a target key is being searched in a sequential data 
structure. In this method, each element in the list is checked and compared against the 
target key. The process is repeated until found or if the end of the file has been reached.
80) How does variable declaration affect memory allocation?
The amount of memory to be allocated or reserved would depend on the data type of 
the variable being declared. For example, if a variable is declared to be of integer type, 
then 32 bits of memory storage will be reserved for that variable.
81) What is the advantage of the heap over a stack?
The heap is more flexible than the stack. That’s because memory space for the heap can 
be dynamically allocated and de-allocated as needed. However, the memory of the heap 
can at times be slower when compared to that stack.
82) What is a postfix expression?
A postfix expression is an expression in which each operator follows its operands. The 
advantage of this form is that there is no need to group sub-expressions in parentheses 
or to consider operator precedence.
83) What is Data abstraction?
Data abstraction is a powerful tool for breaking down complex data problems into 
manageable chunks. This is applied by initially specifying the data objects involved and 
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
the operations to be performed on these data objects without being overly concerned 
with how the data objects will be represented and stored in memory.
84) How do you insert a new item in a binary search tree?
Assuming that the data to be inserted is a unique value (that is, not an existing entry in 
the tree), check first if the tree is empty. If it’s empty, just insert the new item in the root 
node. If it’s not empty, refer to the new item’s key. If it’s smaller than the root’s key, 
insert it into the root’s left subtree, otherwise, insert it into the root’s right subtree.
85) How does a selection sort work for an array?
The selection sort is a fairly intuitive sorting algorithm, though not necessarily efficient. 
In this process, the smallest element is first located and switched with the element at 
subscript zero, thereby placing the smallest element in the first position.
The smallest element remaining in the subarray is then located next to subscripts 1 
through n-1 and switched with the element at subscript 1, thereby placing the second 
smallest element in the second position. The steps are repeated in the same manner till 
the last element.
86) How do signed and unsigned numbers affect memory?
In the case of signed numbers, the first bit is used to indicate whether positive or 
negative, which leaves you with one bit short. With unsigned numbers, you have all bits 
available for that number. The effect is best seen in the number range (an unsigned 8-bit 
number has a range 0-255, while the 8-bit signed number has a range -128 to +127.
87) What is the minimum number of nodes that a binary tree can have?
A binary tree can have a minimum of zero nodes, which occurs when the nodes have 
NULL values. Furthermore, a binary tree can also have 1 or 2 nodes.
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
88) What are dynamic data structures?
Dynamic data structures are structures that expand and contract as a program runs. It 
provides a flexible means of manipulating data because it can adjust according to the 
size of the data.
89) In what data structures are pointers applied?
Pointers that are used in linked list have various applications in the data structure. Data 
structures that make use of this concept include the Stack, Queue, Linked List and Binary 
Tree.
90) Do all declaration statements result in a fixed reservation in memory?
Most declarations do, with the exemption of pointers. Pointer declaration does not 
allocate memory for data, but for the address of the pointer variable. Actual memory 
allocation for the data comes during run-time.
91) What are ARRAYs?
When dealing with arrays, data is stored and retrieved using an index that refers to the 
element number in the data sequence. This means that data can be accessed in any 
order. In programming, an array is declared as a variable having a number of indexed 
elements.
92) What is the minimum number of queues needed when implementing a
priority queue?
The minimum number of queues needed in this case is two. One queue is intended for 
sorting priorities while the other queue is used for actual storage of data.
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
93) Which sorting algorithm is considered the fastest?
There are many types of sorting algorithms: quick sort, bubble sort, balloon sort, radix 
sort, merge sort, etc. Not one can be considered the fastest because each algorithm is 
designed for a particular data structure and data set. It would depend on the data set 
that you would want to sort.
94) Differentiate STACK from ARRAY.
Stack follows a LIFO pattern. It means that data access follows a sequence wherein the 
last data to be stored when the first one to be extracted. Arrays, on the other hand, does 
not follow a particular order and instead can be accessed by referring to the indexed 
element within the array.
95) Give a basic algorithm for searching a binary search tree.
if the tree is empty, then the target is not in the tree, end search
2. if the tree is not empty, the target is in the tree
3. check if the target is in the root item
4. if a target is not in the root item, check if a target is smaller than the root’s value
5. if a target is smaller than the root’s value, search the left subtree
6. else, search the right subtree
96) What is a dequeue?
A dequeue is a double-ended queue. This is a structure wherein elements can be 
inserted or removed from either end.
97) What is a bubble sort and how do you perform it?
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
A bubble sort is one sorting technique that can be applied to data structures such as an 
array. It works by comparing adjacent elements and exchanges their values if they are 
out of order. This method lets the smaller values “bubble” to the top of the list, while 
the larger value sinks to the bottom.
98) What is Cloud Computing ?
Cloud computing is a type of computing that relies on shared computing resources rather than 
having local servers or personal devices to handle applications.
In its most simple description, cloud computing is taking services ("cloud services") and moving 
them outside an organization's firewall. Applications, storage and other services are accessed 
via the Web. The services are delivered and used over the Internet and are paid for by the cloud 
customer on an as-needed or pay-per-use business model.
99) Explain the concept of IOT ?
The internet of things, or IoT, is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and 
digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and 
the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-tocomputer interaction.
100) What is Machine Learning ?
Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the 
ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly 
programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that 
can access data and use it learn for themselves.
The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct 
experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in 
the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the 
computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions 
accordingly.

Round 2: HR
1) Tell me something which is not a part of your resume?
2) What are u doing to increase your communication skills?
3) Are you willing to relocate?
4) Why TCS?
#TCS NQT interview Experience 2
tcs nqt interview questions & experiences 
Attended TCS NQT off-campus for 2018 batch & got selected.
There was one round of interview only which combined Technical, HR, MR rounds. 
Questions were based on my core branch which is Electrical. All of them were basic 
questions like what is your fav subject, what is an induction motor, its applications, etc.
Some questions were from programming like write a program to print Fibonacci series. 
Some HR questions were like – Are you willing to relocate, Are you okay with night shifts etc.
Imp points to note down:
Never lie anything in your application form or resume.
Whether you know anything or not, don’t stay calm in the interview. 
Smile more, be bold, be positive. They never hire candidates who are always serious and 
worried about little things.
Sleep well before the interview and wear neat and clean and proper formal dress. (from hair 
band to shoes). –
If you are cross-questioned at one of your lies, its better to tell the truth.
Do full research about the company before the interview.
Keep your voice loud and clear.
These are all the important traits which the company is looking for. So try to match these
points. All the best !!
PS: If it’s your day, then nothing is gonna stop you. And if it’s not then no matter how hard 
you try, nothing gonna happen. So, the bottom line is that do your best, don’t worry about 
the result.
Also, in the online test, I was asked this coding question – Write a Program to count the 
number of vowels and consonants in the word taken as an input by the user.

According to me, the creativity is not only making new things but also in the improvement of 
existing things. Some people think that doing different things is creativity, But I don't think so. 
Creativity is not only making different things just do things differently.
Relate with a real Example:
Q9. How long would you expect to work for us if hired?
I will work with your company till the day, I feel that I am not giving the best result which is 
required by your company, after trying my level best.
Q10. How do you feel about working nights and weekends?
Company growth is obviously employees growth, Whenever a company needs me, I will be 
there either in nights or weekends.
Note : Don’t say no , they just wanted to check your patience level.
Q11. What are your salary expectations?
As of now, I haven’t thought much about it. I’m more focused on learning the requirements 
for this position that I am applying for.
Q12. What motivates you to do good job?
Responsibility towards work motivates me the most, and my aim within any company is to 
move up to greater levels of responsibility to achieve each goal with better responsibilities.
Q13. Would you lie for the company?
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
It totally depends upon the situation. If lying is the last option to tackle the situation for my 
company I have to do it but only if it is the last, otherwise I will use my creativity to deal with 
the situation because in life we always have the second option. We just need to find it and 
make it count.
Q14. On a scale of one to ten, rate me as an interviewer.
Sir/Mam, I do not have the audacity to rate a highly qualifies person like you. However, if you 
must insist, I would give you a 10 because I am really grateful that you gave me the 
opportunity to sit for thisinterview. This has been a really pleasant experience for me because 
you listened to whatever I said with patience and it is a huge thing for me. Thank you so much.
Q15. Do you have any questions for me?
Thanks sir for giving me this opportunity to ask you a question.
I want to know more about this job profile, and if anything I can learn/improve which can 
benefit the company.
Q16. Are not you overqualified for this position?
No sir/madam, I don't think I am overqualified for this job, in my opinion, qualification does 
not come with theoretical knowledge and experience makes you more qualified because 
analyzing the situation in real time makes us more prominent.And when it comes to 
knowledge learning never ends.
17. What is the difference between hard work and smart work?
HARD WORK : GIVES EXPERIENCE.
SMART WORK : COMES FROM EXPERIENCE.
What is the difference between confidence and over confidence?
" I can do it "- confidence, " Only I can do it "- overconfidence.
" I am suitable for this job "- confidence, " I am the only one suitable for this job "-
overconfidence.
" Trusting yourself "- confidence, " Underestimating others "- overconfidence.
A person is confident when he know the fact better, A person is overconfident when he know 
the facts better than others.
Q18.If you won $20 million lottery, would you still work?
Yes! Money does not give us experience but work does. And this money will be over one day 
but our experience of doing work is not.
If I got $10 million lottery then ill save it for business in future. Firstly, I'll get all the skills, 
knowledge, business strategies and marketing form doing a job in reputed company like yours.

Q21. Being an ECE/Mechanical/Electrical/Civil students why do u want to Join Software 
Industry?
Although I belong to an Electrical/Mechanical/Electronics background over the course of four 
years I have discovered a strong passion for coding and would like to work in the same field 
since one should do the work they enjoy. Moreover here, us saying we have passion is not 
enough we must justify the answer by letting them know about the particular fields/languages 
we have developed our passion in and do not be scared if they ask you a few questions about 
it just to confirm what you are saying is accurate . So don’t even try to bluff with the word 
“passion for coding”

ELECTRONICS ENGINEERING QUESTIONS for SOFTWARE COMPANIES:
Questions: What is Microcontroller and Microprocessor? Name a microcontroller and a 
microprocessor?
Microcontroller
They are a whole complete system in themselves (maybe sometimes specific Operating 
System too). They consist of Processing Unit, RAM, ROM, other external peripherals.
They generally have Harvard Architecture.
The processing speed is comparatively slow.
The addresses in programming are placed outside the IC.
Examples: Arduino, 8051.
Microprocessor:
They only consist of the Processing Unit. They don't have peripherals included in them.
They generally have Von Neumann Architecture.
The processing speed is comparatively faster.
The addresses in programming have their own space.

Q1. Explain Am And Fm.
AM-Amplitude modulation is a type of modulation where the amplitude of the carrier signal 
is varied in accordance with the information bearing signal. FM-Frequency modulation is a 
type of modulation where the frequency of the carrier signal is varied in accordance with the 
information bearing signal.
Q2. Name The Modulation Techniques.
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
For Analog modulation–AM, SSB, FM, PM and SM .
Digital modulation–OOK, FSK, ASK, Psk, QAM, MSK,CPM, PPM, TCM, OFDM.
Q3. What Is Demodulation?
Demodulation is the act of removing the modulation from an analog signal to get the original 
baseband signal back. Demodulating is necessary because the receiver system receives a 
modulated signal with specific characteristics and it needs to turn it to base-band.
Q4. What Is Cut-off Frequency?
The frequency at which the response is --3dB with respect to the maximum response.
Q5. What Is Op--amp?
An operational amplifier, often called an op--amp , is a DCcoupled high -gain electronic voltage 
amplifier with differential inputs and, usually, a single output. Typically the output of the 
op-amp is controlled either by negative feedback, which largely determines the magnitude of its 
output voltage gain, or by positive feedback, which facilitates regenerative gain and oscillation.
Q6. What Is Transistor?
In electronics, a transistor is a semiconductor device commonly used to amplify or switch 
electronic signals. The transistor is the fundamental building block of computers, and all other 
modernelectronic devices. Some transistors are packaged individually but most are found in 
integrated circuits.
Q7. What Is Diode?
In electronics, a diode is a two-terminal device. Diodes have two active electrodes between 
which the signal of interest may flow, and most are used for their unidirectional current 
property.
Q8. What Is A Semi Conductor?
A semiconductor is a solid material that has electrical conductivityin between that of a 
conductor and that of an insulator(AnInsulator is a material that resists the flow of electric 
current. It is an object intended to support or separate electrical conductorswithout passing 
current through itself); it can vary over that wide range either permanently or dynamically.
Q9. What Is Conductor?
A substance, body, or device that readily conducts heat, electricity, sound, etc. Copper is a good 
conductor of electricity.
Q10. What Is Inductor?
An inductor is a passive electrical device employed in electrical circuits for its property of 
inductance. An inductor can take many forms.
Q11. What Is Capacitor?
A capacitor is an electrical/electronic device that can store energyin the electric field between a 
pair of conductors (called “plates”). The process of storing energy in the capacitor is known as 
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
“charging”, and involves electric charges of equal magnitude, but opposite polarity, building up 
on each plate. 
Capacitors are often used in electric and electronic circuits asenergy-storage devices. They can 
also be used to differentiate between high-frequency and low-frequency signals. This property 
makes them useful in electronic filters.
Q12. What Is A Rectifier?
A rectifier changes alternating current into direct current. This process is called rectification. 
The three main types of rectifier are the half-wave, full-wave, and bridge. A rectifier is the 
opposite of an inverter, which changes direct current into alternating current. HWR- The 
simplest type is the half-wave rectifier, which can be made with just one diode. When the
voltage of the alternating current is positive, the diode becomes forwardbiased and current 
flows through it. When the voltage is negative, the diode is reverse-biased and the current 
stops.
Q13. What Is An Integrated Circuit?
An integrated circuit (IC), also called a microchip, is an electronic circuit etched onto a silicon 
chip. Their main advantages are low cost, low power, high performance, and very small size.
Q14. What Is Oscillator?
An oscillator is a circuit that creates a waveform output from a direct current input. The two 
main types of oscillator are harmonic and relaxation. The harmonic oscillators have smooth 
curved waveforms, while relaxation oscillators have waveforms with sharp changes.
Q15. What Is A Feedback? And Explain Different Types Of Feedback.
Feedback is a process whereby some proportion of the output signal of a system is passed (fed 
back) to the input. This is often used to control the dynamic behaviour of the system.
Types of feedback:
Negative feedback: This tends to reduce output (but in amplifiers, stabilizes and linearizes 
operation). Negative feedback feeds part of a system’s output, inverted, into the system’s 
input; generally with the result that fluctuations are attenuated.
Positive feedback: This tends to increase output. Positive feedback, sometimes referred to as 
“cumulative causation”, is a feedback loop system in which the system responds to 
perturbation (Aperturbation means a system, is an alteration of function, induced by external or 
internal mechanisms) in the same direction as the perturbation. In contrast, a system that 
responds to the perturbation in the opposite direction is called a negative feedback system. 
Bipolar feedback: which can either increase or decrease output.
Q16. Explain Full Duplex And Half Duplex.
Full duplex refers to the transmission of data in two directions simultaneously. For example, a 
telephone is a full-duplex devicebecause both parties can talk at once. In contrast, a 
walkie-talkie is ahalf-duplex device because only one party can transmit at a time. Most 
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
modems have a switch that lets you choose between full-duplex and half-duplex modes. The 
choice depends on whichcommunications program you are running.
In full-duplex mode, data you transmit does not appear on yourscreen until it has been received 
and sent back by the other party. This enables you to validate that the data has been accurately 
transmitted. If your display screen shows two of each character, it probably means that your 
modem is set to half-duplex mode when it should be in full-duplex mode.
Q17. What Is Barkhausen Criteria?
Barkhausen criteria, without which you will not know which conditions, are to be satisfied for 
oscillations. 
“Oscillations will not be sustained if, at the oscillator frequency, the magnitude of the product 
of the transfer gain of the amplifier and the magnitude of the feedback factor of the feedback 
network ( the magnitude of the loop gain ) are less than unity”.
The condition of unity loop gain ­Aβ = 1 is called the Barkhausencriterion. This condition implies 
that | Aβ|= 1and that the phase of – Aβ is zero.
Q18. What Is An Amplifier?
An electronic device or electrical circuit that is used to boost (amplify) the power, voltage or 
current of an applied signal.
Q19. What Is Cdma, Tdma, Fdma?
Code division multiple access (CDMA) is a channel access methodutilized by various radio 
communication technologies. CDMA employsspread-spectrum technology and a special coding 
scheme (where each transmitter is assigned a code) to allow multiple users to be multiplexed 
over the same physical channel. By contrast, time division multiple access (TDMA) divides 
access by time, whilefrequency-division multiple access (FDMA) divides it byfrequency.
An analogy to the problem of multiple access is a room (channel) in which people wish to 
communicate with each other. To avoid confusion, people could take turns speaking (time 
division), speak at different pitches (frequency division), or speak in different directions (spatial 
division). 
In CDMA, they would speak different languages. People speaking the same language can 
understand each other, but not other people. Similarly, in radio CDMA, each group of users is 
given a shared code. Many codes occupy the same channel, but only users associated with a 
particular code can understand each other.
Q20. What Is Multiplexing?
Multiplexing (known as muxing) is a term used to refer to a processwhere multiple analog
message signals or digital data streams are combined into one signal over a shared medium. 
The aim is to share an expensive resource. For example, in telecommunications, several phone 
calls may be transferred using one wire.

Q21. What Is A Repeater?
A repeater is an electronic device that receives a signal and retransmits it at a higher level 
and/or higher power, or onto the other side of an obstruction, so that the signal can cover 
longer distances without degradation.
Q22. Difference Between Electronic And Electrical.
Electronics work on DC and with a voltage range of -48vDC to +48vDC. If the electronic device is 
plugged into a standard wall outlet, there will be a transformer inside which will convert the AC 
voltage you are supplying to the required DC voltage needed by the device.
Examples: Computer, radio, T.V, etc… 
Electric devices use line voltage (120vAC, 240vAC, etc…).Electric devices can also be designed to 
operate on DC sources, but will be at DC voltages above 48v.
Examples: incandescent lights, heaters, fridge, stove, etc…

MECHNAICAL BRANCH INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:
Q1. What Is Extrued Aluminum?
Extrusion is the process where a metal or a metal bar is pulled through a mandrel to elongate it 
and/or give it a final shape.
Extruded Aluminum is a common form of making small aluminum wire, bars or beams and many 
varieties of small non-structural, decorative pieces.
Q2. What Is The Mechanical Advantage Of A Double Pulley?
It only takes half the effort to move an object but twice the distance.
Q3. What Is Knurling?
Knurling is a machining process normally carried our on a centre lathe. The act of Knurling 
creates a raised criss-cross pattern on a smooth round bar that could be used as a handle or 
something that requires extra grip.
Q4. How Does Hydraulic Clutches Work?
By using a non-compressible fluid, it acts like a solid push rod.
Q5. Why Is Over-pressurizing An Air Conditioning System Bad?
Overcharging a refrigeration or air conditioning system can result in an explosion. To avoid 
serious injury or death, never overcharge the system. Always use proper charging techniques. 
Limit charge amounts to those specified on the system equipment serial label or in the original 
equipment manufacturer's service information.
Overcharging the system immerses the compressor motor, piston, connecting rods, and 
cylinders in liquid refrigerant. This creates a hydraulic block preventing the compressor from 
starting. The hydraulic block is also known as locked rotor.
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
Continued supply of electricity to the system causes heat to build in the compressor. This heat 
will eventually vaporize the refrigerant and rapidly increase system pressure. If, for any reason, 
the thermal protector fails to open the electrical circuit, system pressure can raise to high 
enough levels to cause a compressor-housing explosion.
Q6. Will A Steel Cable Become Longer If It Is Heated While Under Load?
Even the heaviest steel cables stretch under load, whether they heat or not. Heating the cable 
will certainly elongate it. Friction caused by guides or pulleys can greatly increase the 
temperature of a cable under load.
You might consider the possibility of total failure if the heat is high enough and I am not sure 
but the cable might act in unpredictable ways when it fails. Applying heat to a steel cable under 
load is probably dangerous to your health and the health of anyone nearby.
When steel is heated, steel expands. It does not need to be under load. That is the reason that 
in the old days before advanced electronics and optics surveyors used chains rather than cables 
for measuring land. Had they used cable they would have gotten different measurements in 
summer and winter based on the difference in temperature and the coefficient of expansion of 
the material. The coefficient of expansion is a number that informs just how much a given 
material will expand or contract for a given change in temperature.
To find the coefficient of expansion and other interesting information consult a materials 
handbook, available in better libraries or your local college of engineering. Another example of 
expanding steel and the necessity for dealing with this characteristic is the overlapping slip joint 
found on bridges that allows horizontal structural members to expand and contract without 
damaging the bridge.
Q7. What Is The Congressional Space Medal Of Honor?
The medal was created in 1969, designed by Congress for "any astronaut who in the 
performance of his duties has distinguished himself by exceptionally meritorious efforts and 
contributions to the welfare of the Nation and mankind.
Q8. What Is The Law Of Thermodynamics?
There are actually 3 Laws of Thermodynamics (the actual number is debatable, but the number 
ranges from 3-5, depending on your adding skills).
Q9. Is It The Stress That, Produces Strain Or Strain Produces Stress?
A Force applied to an object will cause a displacement. Strain is effectively a measure of this 
displacement (change in length divided by original length).
Stress is the Force applied divided by the area it is applied. (E.g. pounds per square inch)
Therefore, to answer the question, the applied force produces both “Stress and Strain”. “Stress 
and Strain” are linked together by various material properties such as Poisson's ratio and 
Young's Modulus.
Q10.. How Does A Super Charger Work In A Car?
A supercharger is a used to increase the volume of air dragged into each cylinder per stroke.
In combustion engines, there are only really two ways to increase power, firstly increase the 
amount of fuel in the engine (either increase the displacement, or add more cylinders) or 
increase the amount of air in the engine (for a more effective explosion of the fuel)
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
Superchargers are powered by the engines crankshaft, which is connected usually by a belt 
drive. This rotational power turns a fan, which sucks air into the intake manifold similar in effect 
to turbochargers, with reduced lag. However, superchargers take more energy out the engine, 
so swings and roundabouts.
Q11. Why Do The Radiators In Your House Click When You Start The Heating System?
They are clicking because they are heating up. The heat causes expansion and that is why you 
hear clicking.
Q12. How Can I See Where Pipes Are Behind The Wall?
By using radio waves.
Q13. How Are The Pneumatic System And The Hydraulic System Similar?
Pneumatics use gases such as air or nitrogen, hydraulics use oil or water, both systems use 
pressure to act on a specific application.
Q14. What Is The Difference Between An Electric Motor And An Electric Generator?
There is no fundamental difference between an electric motor and an electric generator or 
dynamo. In normal use, all motors behave as generators, and all generators behave as motors. 
DC Motors act like generators because they use less electrical energy when allowed to spin fast. 
DC generators act like motors because they become easier to spin when less electrical energy is
drawn from their terminals.
For example, connect two small DC magnet motors together. Then if you spin the shaft of the 
first motor, the second motor's shaft will start spinning too. One acts as a DC generator, and the 
other acts as a DC motor. Alternatively, spin the second one's shaft, and the first one will start 
spinning.
Another example: If you connect a small DC motor to a small battery, then an electric current 
will appear in the motor's coils, and the motor starts spinning. However, if you spin the motor's 
shaft slightly faster than the normal speed, the direction of current in the circuit will reverse, 
and the battery starts taking in energy from the motor. The motor has become a generator, and 
it is recharging the battery.
Question 15. What Are Some Examples Of A Periscope?
It is an optical instrument for viewing objects, which are above the level of direct sight; mostly 
used in submarines.
Maintenance, repair and operations (MRO)
Q16. What Does Green Field Project Mean?
Green field projects are those projects, which do not create any environmental nuisance 
(pollution), follows environmental management system and EIA (environment impact 
assessment). These projects are usually of big magnitude.
Q17.is Pipe Round Because It Provides The Least Area To Volume Ratio?

COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
More likely because it is easier to manufacture, much easier to put threads on, you do not have 
to worry about orientation when you put them together, and they have no weak spots created 
by corners.
My gutter pipes are rectangular because they do not stick out as far from the house as a circular 
one with the same area. However, they are low enough in the pressure they contain that they 
can be formed from sheet metal with a crimped seam. Making a water supply pipe, that way 
would be impossible.
In addition, it is easy to keep them aligned to the house. Running a rectangular water main 
under a street would be a major pain.
Solar Water Pumps Interview Questions
Q18.How Does Hydraulics Work?
A positive displacement pump (gear, vane, or piston pump) is driven by a prime mover 
(Electrical Motor or Engine) it sucks fluid from reservoir and delivers oil to system. During 
loading, a resistance to flow creates the pressure, which is utilized to do the work through 
cylinder for linear motion, or through hydraulic motor for rotary motion, Direction of flow is 
changed with help of direction control valve & system pressure is regulated by pressure control 
valve & flow is regulated by flow control valve.
Q19.What Is The Difference Between Hydraulic Oil And Engine Oil?
Both the hydraulic and engine oils are made from base oils with additives mixed in. The 
additives used change the characteristics of the oils so that they function differently.
Generally, hydraulic oils (final product including additives) are expected to have very low 
compressibility and very predictable friction and viscosity stability under pressure.
Generally engine oils (Engine Lubrication Oils anyway) are intended to have high resistance to 
heat (degradation including chemical and viscosity due to heat) resistance to burning and 
resistance to absorption of fuels and chemical compounds produced during combustion.
Both classes of oils are likely to have additives intended to provide detergency and to reduce 
foaming.
Base oils are most commonly petroleum oil bases due to cost, but other bases oil can be used 
including mineral oils (especially for hydraulic oils) and plant oils (especially for engine oils) and 
oils from animal sources.
Q20.What Does Angular Momentum Mean?
Angular momentum is an expression of an objects mass and rotational speed.
Momentum is the velocity of an object times it is mass, or how fast something is moving how 
much it weigh. Therefore, angular momentum is the objects mass times the angular velocity 
where angular velocity is how fast something is rotating expressed in terms like revolutions per 
minute or radians per second or degrees per second

Q2. What Is Electric Traction?
Electric traction means using the electric power for traction system (i.e. for railways,trams, 
trolleys etc).
Electric traction means use of the electricity for railways,trams, trolleys etc. Now a days, 
magnetic traction is also used for bullet trains.and basically dc motors are used for electric 
traction systems.
Q3.What Is “pu” In Electrical Engineering?
Pu stands for per unit and this will be used in single line diagram of power distribution and it is 
like a huge electrical circuit with no of components (generators, transformers, loads) with 
different ratings (in MVA and KV). To bring all the ratings into common platform we use pu 
concept in which, in general largest MVA and KV ratings of the component is considered as base 
values, then all other component ratings will get back into this basis.Those values are called as 
pu values.
Q4.Why Link Is Provided In Neutral Of An Ac Circuit And Fuse In Phase Of Ac Circuit?
Link is provided at a Neutral common point in the circuit from which various connection are 
taken for the individual control circuit and so it is given in a link form to withstand high Amps. 
But in the case of Fuse in the Phase of AC circuit it is designed such that the fuse rating is 
calculated for the particular circuit (i.e load) only.So if any malfunction happen the fuse 
connected in the particular control circuit alone will blow off.
Q5. How Tube Light Circuit Is Connected And How It Works?
A choke is connected in one end of the tube light and a starter is in series with the circuit. When 
supply is provided ,the starter will interrupt the supply cycle of AC. Due to the sudden change of 
supply the chock will generate around 1000volts . This volt will capable of to break the electrons 
inside the tube to make electron flow. once the current passes through the tube the starter 
circuit will be out of part. now there is no change of supply causes choke voltage normalized 
and act as minimize the current.
Q6.What Is Marx Circuit?
It is used with generators for charging a number of capacitor in parallel and discharging them in 
series.It is used when voltage required for testing is higher than the available

Q8.Why Human Body Feel Electric Shock ?? N In An electric Train During Running , We Did Nt 
Feel Any shock ? Why?
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
Unfortunately our body is a pretty good conductor of electricity, The golden rule is Current 
takes the lowest resistant path if you have insulation to our feet as the circuit is not complete 
(wearing rubber footwear which doing some repairs is advisable as our footwear is a high 
resistance path not much current flows through our body).The electric train is well insulated 
from its electrical system.
Q9. What Is The Principle Of Motor?
Whenever a current carrying conductor is placed in an magnetic field it produce turning or 
twisting movemnt is called as torque.
Q10. Why, When Birds Sit On Transmission Lines Or Current Wires Doesn’t Get Shock?
Its true that if birds touch the single one line (phase or neutral) they don’t get electrical shock… 
if birds touch 2 lines than the circuit is closed and they get electrical shock.. so if a human touch 
single one line(phase) then he doesn’t get shock if he is in the air (not touching – standing on 
the ground if he is standing on the ground then touching the line (phase) he will get a shock 
because the ground on what we standing is like line (ground bed – like neutral)? and in the 
most of electric lines the neutral is grounded..so that means that human who touch the line 
closes the circuit between phase and neutral.
Q11.What Happen If We Give 220 Volts Dc Supply To D Bulb R Tube Light?
Bulbs [devices] for AC are designed to operate such that it offers high impedance to AC supply. 
Normally they have low resistance. When DC supply is applied, due to low resistance, the 
current through lamp would be so high that it may damage the bulb element.
Q12. Which Motor Has High Starting Torque And Staring Current Dc Motor, Induction Motor 
Or Synchronous Motor?
DC Series motor has high starting torque. We can not start the Induction motor and 
Synchronous motors on load, but can not start the DC series motor without load.
Q13.What Is Acsr Cable And Where We Use It?
ACSR means Aluminium conductor steel reinforced, this conductor is used in transmission & 
distribution.
Q14. What Will Happen When Power Factor Is Leading In Distribution Of Power?
If their is high power factor, i.e if the power factor is close to one:
losses in form of heat will be reduced,
cable becomes less bulky and easy to carry, and very cheap to afford, &
it also reduces over heating of tranformers.
Q15. What Is The One Main Difference Between Ups & Inverter ? And Electrical Engineering & 
Electronics Engineering ?

start with 2v dc with 7 amp. but inverter is startwith 2v,24,dc to 36v dc and 20amp to 80amp 
battery with long time backup.
Q16. What Is 2 Phase Motor?
A two phase motor is a motor with the the starting winding and the running winding have a 
phase split.
e.g;ac servo motor.where the auxiliary winding and the control winding have a phase split of 90 
degree
Q17. What Is Power Factor? Whether It Should Be High Or Low? Why?
Power factor should be high in order to get smooth operation of the system.Low power factor 
means losses will be more.it is the ratio of true power to apparent power. it has to be ideally 1. 
if it is too low then cable over heating & equipment overloading will occur.
if it is greater than 1 then load will act as capacitor and starts feeding the source and will cause 
tripping.(if pf is poor ex: 0.17 to meet actual power load has to draw more current(V 
constant),result in more losses if pf is good.
ex: 0.95 to meet actual power load has to draw less current(V constant),result in less losses).
Q18. There Are A Transformer And An Induction Machine. Those Two Have The Same Supply. 
For Which Device The Load Current Will Be Maximum? And Why?
The motor has max load current compare to that of transformer because the motor consumes 
real power.. and the transformer is only producing the working flux and its not consuming.. 
hence the load current in the transformer is because of core loss so it is minimum.
Q19. Explain The Working Principal Of The Circuit Breaker?
Circuit Breaker is one which makes or breaks the circuit.It has two contacts namely fixed 
contact & moving contact.under normal condition the moving contact comes in contact with 
fixed contact thereby forming the closed contact for the flow of current. During abnormal & 
faulty conditions(when current exceeds the rated value) an arc is produced between the fixed & 
moving contacts & thereby it forms the open circuitArc is extinguished by the Arc Quenching 
media like air, oil, vaccum etc
Q20. How Many Types Of Colling System It Transformers?

COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
Generally capacitor gives infinite resistance to dc components(i.e., block the dc components). it 
allows the ac components to pass through.
Q23. What Happens If I Connect A Capacitor To A Generator Load?
Connecting a capacitor across a generator always improves power factor,but it will help 
depends up on the engine capacity of the alternator,other wise the alternator will be over 
loaded due to the extra watts consumed due to the improvement on pf. Secondly, don’t 
connect a capacitor across an alternator while it is picking up or without any other load.
Q24. What Is The Difference Between Surge Arrestor And Lightning Arrestor?
LA is installed outside and the effect of lightning is grounded,where as surge arrestor installed 
inside panels comprising of resistors which consumes the energy and nullify the effect of surge.
Q25. Why Use The Vcb At High Transmission System ? Why Can’t Use Acb?
Actually the thing is vacuum has high arc queching property compare to air because in VCB ,the 
die electric strengths equal to 8 times of air . That is y always vaccum used as in HT breaker and 
air used as in LT .
Q26. Difference Between A Four Point Starter And Three Point Starter?
The shunt connection in four point stater is provided separately form the line where as in three 
point stater it is connected with line which is the drawback in three point stater.
OPERATING SYSTEM QUESTIONS:
1) Explain the main purpose of an operating system?
Operating systems exist for two main purposes. One is that it is designed to make sure a 
computer system performs well by managing its computational activities. Another is that it 
provides an environment for the development and execution of programs.
2) What is demand paging?
Demand paging is referred when not all of a process’s pages are in the RAM, then the OS brings 
the missing(and required) pages from the disk into the RAM.
3) What are the advantages of a multiprocessor system?
With an increased number of processors, there is a considerable increase in throughput. It can 
also save more money because they can share resources. Finally, overall reliability is increased 
as well.
4) What is kernel?
A kernel is the core of every operating system. It connects applications to the actual processing 
of data. It also manages all communications between software and hardware components to 
ensure usability and reliability.
5) What are real-time systems?
Real-time systems are used when rigid time requirements have been placed on the operation of 
a processor. It has well defined and fixed time constraints.
6) What is a virtual memory?
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
Virtual memory is a memory management technique for letting processes execute outside of 
memory. This is very useful especially is an executing program cannot fit in the physical 
memory.
7) Describe the objective of multiprogramming.
The main objective of multiprogramming is to have a process running at all times. With this 
design, CPU utilization is said to be maximized.
8 ) What is time- sharing system?
In a Time-sharing system, the CPU executes multiple jobs by switching among them, also known 
as multitasking. This process happens so fast that users can interact with each program while it 
is running.
9) What is SMP?
SMP is a short form of Symmetric Multi-Processing. It is the most common type of multipleprocessor systems. In this system, each processor runs an identical copy of the operating 
system, and these copies communicate with one another as needed.
10) How are server systems classified?
Server systems can be classified as either computer-server systems or file server systems. In the 
first case, an interface is made available for clients to send requests to perform an action. In the 
second case, provisions are available for clients to create, access and update files.
11) What is asymmetric clustering?
In asymmetric clustering, a machine is in a state known as hot standby mode where it does 
nothing but to monitor the active server. That machine takes the active server’s role should the 
server fails.
12) What is a thread?
A thread is a basic unit of CPU utilization. In general, a thread is composed of a thread ID, 
program counter, register set, and the stack.
13) Give some benefits of multithreaded programming.
– there is increased responsiveness to the user
– resource sharing within the process
– economy
– utilization of multiprocessing architecture
14) Briefly explain FCFS.
FCFS stands for First-come, first-served. It is one type of scheduling algorithm. In this scheme, 
the process that requests the CPU first is allocated the CPU first. Implementation is managed by 
a FIFO queue.
15) What is RR scheduling algorithm?
RR (round-robin) scheduling algorithm is primarily aimed for time-sharing systems. A circular 
queue is a setup in such a way that the CPU scheduler goes around that queue, allocating CPU 
to each process for a time interval of up to around 10 to 100 milliseconds.

16) What are necessary conditions which can lead to a deadlock situation in a system?
Deadlock situations occur when four conditions occur simultaneously in a system: Mutual 
exclusion; Hold and Wait; No preemption; and Circular wait.
17) Enumerate the different RAID levels.
RAID 0 – Non-redundant striping
RAID 1 – Mirrored Disks
RAID 2 – Memory-style error-correcting codes
RAID 3 – Bit-interleaved Parity
RAID 4 – Block-interleaved Parity
RAID 5 – Block-interleaved distributed Parity
RAID 6 – P+Q Redundancy
18) Describe Banker’s algorithm
Banker’s algorithm is one form of deadlock-avoidance in a system. It gets its name from a 
banking system wherein the bank never allocates available cash in such a way that it can no 
longer satisfy the needs of all of its customers.
19) What factors determine whether a detection-algorithm must be utilized in a deadlock 
avoidance system?
One is that it depends on how often a deadlock is likely to occur under the implementation of 
this algorithm. The other has to do with how many processes will be affected by deadlock when 
this algorithm is applied.
20) State the main difference between logical from physical address space.
Logical address refers to the address that is generated by the CPU. On the other hand, physical 
address refers to the address that is seen by the memory unit.
21) How does dynamic loading aid in better memory space utilization?
With dynamic loading, a routine is not loaded until it is called. This method is especially useful 
when large amounts of code are needed in order to handle infrequently occurring cases such as 
error routines.
22) What are overlays?
Overlays are used to enable a process to be larger than the amount of memory allocated to it. 
The basic idea of this is that only instructions and data that are needed at any given time are 
kept in memory.
23) What is the basic function of paging?
Paging is a memory management scheme that permits the physical address space of a process 
to be noncontiguous. It avoids the considerable problem of having to fit varied sized memory 
chunks onto the backing store.
24) What is fragmentation?
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
Fragmentation is memory wasted. It can be internal if we are dealing with systems that have 
fixed-sized allocation units, or external if we are dealing with systems that have variable-sized 
allocation units.
25) How does swapping result in better memory management?
During regular intervals that are set by the operating system, processes can be copied from 
main memory to a backing store, and then copied back later. Swapping allows more operations 
to be run that can fit into memory at one time.
26) Give an example of a Process State.
– New State – means a process is being created
– Running – means instructions are being executed
– Waiting – means a process is waiting for certain conditions or events to occur
– Ready – means a process is waiting for an instruction from the main processor
– Terminate – means a process is stopped abruptly
27) What is a socket?
A socket provides a connection between two applications. Each endpoint of a communication is 
a socket.
28) What is Direct Access Method?
Direct Access method is based on a disk model of a file, such that it is viewed as a numbered 
sequence of blocks or records. It allows arbitrary blocks to be read or written. Direct access is 
advantageous when accessing large amounts of information.
29) When does thrashing occur?
Thrashing refers to an instance of high paging activity. This happens when it is spending more 
time paging instead of executing.
30) What is the best page size when designing an operating system?
The best paging size varies from system to system, so there is no single best when it comes to 
page size. There are different factors to consider in order to come up with a suitable page size, 
such as page table, paging time, and its effect on the overall efficiency of the operating system.
31) When designing the file structure for an operating system, what attributes are 
considered?
Typically, the different attributes for a file structure are naming, identifier, supported file types, 
and location for the files, size, and level of protection.
32) What is root partition?
Root partition is where the operating system kernel is located. It also contains other potentially 
important system files that are mounted during boot time.
33) What are device drivers?
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
Device drivers provide a standard means of representing I/O devices that maybe manufactured 
by different companies. This prevents conflicts whenever such devices are incorporated in a 
systems unit.
34) What are the primary functions of VFS?
VFS, or Virtual File System, separate file system generic operations from their implementation 
by defining a clean VFS interface. It is based on a file-representation structure known as vnode, 
which contains a numerical designator needed to support network file systems.
35) What are the different types of CPU registers in a typical operating system design?
– Accumulators
– Index Registers
– Stack Pointer
– General Purpose Registers
36) What is the purpose of an I/O status information?
I/O status information provides information about which I/O devices are to be allocated for a 
particular process. It also shows which files are opened, and other I/O device state.
37) What is multitasking?
Multitasking is the process within an operating system that allows the user to run several 
applications at the same time. However, only one application is active at a time for user 
interaction, although some applications can run “behind the scene”.
38) Explain pros and cons of a command line interface?
A command line interface allows the user to type in commands that can immediately provide 
results. Many seasoned computer users are well accustomed to using the command line 
because they find it quicker and simpler.
However, the main problem with a command line interface is that users have to be familiar with 
the commands, including the switches and parameters that come with it. This is a downside for 
people who are not fond of memorizing commands.
39) What is caching?
Caching is the processing of utilizing a region of fast memory for a limited data and process. A 
cache memory is usually much efficient because of its high access speed.
40) What is spooling?
Spooling is normally associated with printing. When different applications want to send an 
output to the printer at the same time, spooling takes all of these print jobs into a disk file and 
queues them accordingly to the printer.
41) What is an Assembler?
An assembler acts as a translator for low-level language. Assembly codes written using 
mnemonic commands are translated by the Assembler into machine language.
42) What are interrupts?
Prepared by: Ex. TATA EMPLOYEE “PRATIK SHRIVASTAVA”
COMPREHENSIVE INTERVIEW MATERIAL DESIGNED BY ONLINESTUDY4U
Interrupts are part of a hardware mechanism that sends a notification to the CPU when it wants 
to gain access to a particular resource. An interrupt handler receives this interrupt signal and 
“tells” the processor to take action based on the interrupt request.
43) What is GUI?
GUI is short for Graphical User Interface. It provides users with an interface wherein actions can 
be performed by interacting with icons and graphical symbols. People find it easier to interact 
with the computer when in a GUI especially when using the mouse. Instead of having to 
remember and type commands, users click on buttons to perform a process.
44) What is preemptive multitasking?
Preemptive multitasking allows an operating system to switch between software programs. 
This, in turn, allows multiple programs to run without necessarily taking complete control over 
the processor and resulting in system crashes.
45) Why partitioning and formatting is a prerequisite to installing an operating system?
Partitioning and formatting create a preparatory environment on the drive so that the 
operating system can be copied and installed properly. This includes allocating space on the
drive, designating a drive name, determining and creating the appropriate file system and 
structure.
46) What is plumbing/piping?
It is the process of using the output of one program as an input to another. For example, 
instead of sending the listing of a folder or drive to the main screen, it can be piped and sent to 
a file, or sent to the printer to produce a hard copy.
47) What is NOS?
NOS is short for Network Operating System. It is a specialized software that will allow a 
computer to communicate with other devices over the network, including file/folder sharing.
48) Differentiate internal commands from external commands.
Internal commands are built-in commands that are already part of the operating system. 
External commands are separate file programs that are stored in a separate folder or directory.
49) Under DOS, what command will you type when you want to list down the files in a 
directory, and at the same time pause after every screen output?
a) dir /w
b) dir /p
c) dir /s
d) dir /w /p
Answer: d) dir /w /p
50) How would a file name EXAMPLEFILE.TXT appear when viewed under the DOS command 
console operating in Windows 98?
The filename would appear as EXAMPL~1.TXT . The reason behind this is that filenames under 
this operating system are limited to 8 characters when working under DOS environment.

51) What is a folder in Ubuntu?
There is no concept of Folder in Ubuntu. Everything included in your hardware is a FILE.
52) Explain why Ubuntu is safe and not affected by viruses?
It does not support malicious e-mails and contents, and before any e-mail is opened by users it 
will go through many security checks
Ubuntu uses Linux, which is a super secure O.S system
Unlike other O.S, countless Linux users can see the code at any time and can fix the problem if 
there is any
Malware and viruses are coded to take advantage of the weakness in Windows
53) Explain what is Unity in Ubuntu? How can you add new entries to the launcher?
In Ubuntu, Unity is the default graphical shell. On the left side of the Ubuntu, it introduces the 
launcher and Dash to start programs.
In order to add new entries to the launcher, you can create a file name like .desktop and then 
drag the file on the launcher.
54) Explain the purpose of using a libaio package in Ubuntu?
Libaio is Linux Kernel Asynchronous I/O (A/O). A/O allows even a single application thread to 
overlap I/O operations with other processing, by providing an interface for submitting one or 
more I/O requests in one system call without waiting for completion. And a separate interface 
to reap completed I/O operations associated with a given completion group.
55) What is the use of behavior tab in Ubuntu?
Through behaviors tab, you can make many changes on the appearance of the desktop
Auto-hide the launcher: You can use this option to reveal the launcher when moving the pointer 
to the defined hot spot.
Enable workspaces: By checking this option, you can enable workspace
Add show desktop icon to the launcher: This option is used to display the desktop icon on the 
launcher
56) What is the meaning of “export” command in Ubuntu?
Export is a command in Bash shell language. When you try to set a variable, it is visible or 
exported to any subprocess started from that instance of bash. The variable will not exist in the 
sub-process without the export command.
57) Explain how you can reset Unity Configuration?
To reset the unity configuration the simplest way to do is to hit open a Terminal or hit Atl-F2 
and run the command # unity –reset
